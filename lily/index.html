                <p>
                  After downloading all files and documentation you will have a
                  <strong>.zip</strong> file available. Once you unzip this file
                  you will find the following:
                </p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>
                  The WordPress theme is labeled as <strong>lily.zip</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                  Please note as further updates are made to the theme, the zip
                  file will be suffixed with the corresponding version number
                  (e.g. lily-2.0.zip).
                </p>
                <h2>WordPress Upload</h2>
                <p>
                  To upload through your Dashboard, select
                  <strong
                    >Appearance &rarr; Themes &rarr; Add New &rarr; Upload
                    Theme</strong
                  >. Choose your theme zip file and select "Install Now". Once
                  the theme is fully uploaded and installed, click "Activate" to
                  activate the WordPress theme.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When uploading your theme with the installer, make sure you
                  are uploading the theme .zip file, not the entire package you
                  downloaded. This means you will be uploading
                  <strong>lily.zip</strong>.
                </p>
                <h2>FTP Upload</h2>
                <p>
                  To manually upload your new WordPress theme, login with your
                  credentials to your website and locate the wp-content folder
                  in your WordPress install files. Upload the
                  <strong>un-zipped</strong> Lily folder into the:
                  wp-content/themes folder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once uploaded, activate the theme by heading to
                  <strong>Appearance &rarr; Themes</strong> menu in the
                  WordPress Dashboard. Locate the Lily theme and hit "Activate".
                </p>
                <h2>Demo Content</h2>
                <p>
                  You can install the theme demo content using the
                  <strong>lily.wordpress.yyyy-mm-dd.xml</strong> file which
                  comes included in the main download.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first thing you will need to do is go to
                  <strong>Tools &rarr; Import</strong>. Bear in mind if you have
                  never done this before you will be asked to install an
                  importer. Make sure you select the WordPress option.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After installing and activating the importer plugin you will
                  now be able to upload the above <strong>.xml</strong> file.
                  Just navigate to the same area as you did above and select the
                  option you prefer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can either assign the demo content to an existing author
                  or you can import the one included within the demo content
                  itself - there is no right or wrong here so just choose
                  whichever option you prefer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, you will see another section labeled "Import
                  Attachments". Within this, there is a checkbox which you can
                  tick to <strong>Download and import file attachments</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                  Please note that this process can take some time to complete
                  depending on the demo content file size which is being
                  imported. In addition, please note that the uploaded
                  attachments are <strong>placeholders only</strong> and not
                  those found in the live preview.

                  settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Colors:</strong> Change body text, accent, hover,
                  header text, background, alpha transparency colors to any
                  color of your choice. To do this, simply click on the "Colors"
                  section and use the color picker to choose your preference.
                  You can also change the alpha transparency opacity level where
                  the property is used. All changes will update live within the

                  <strong>Header Image:</strong> Lily uses this option to set
                  the homepage header image. To set this up select an image from
                  your library or upload a new image. For optimal resolution I
                  would recommend to skip cropping and publish the image as is.
                  You can also randomize this by adding multiple images to the
                  collection, turn on the slideshow feature, as well as your
                  speed preference.

                  Please make sure not to upload images which are very large as
                  this will affect your page loading time. The recommended
                  dimension is <strong>1920 x 1080</strong>. I would also
                  strongly recommend these images be losslessly compressed if

                <p>
                  The theme includes a custom homepage page template that allows
                  you to have a completely widgetized homepage layout.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Simply create a new page and label it whatever you want. I
                  called mine Homepage to keep things simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, select the <strong>Homepage</strong> page template
                  option found in the Page Attributes meta box. Click on the
                  Publish button and you're done.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you have followed the above steps, make sure you go
                  <strong>Settings &rarr; Reading</strong> and select this same
                  page as your Front page option. Your posts page can have an
                  alternate page assigned to it as well.

                  If you chose to setup your homepage to use the homepage
                  template above, you'll need to also tell WordPress which page
                  will display your posts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To do this go to <strong>Pages &rarr; Add New</strong> to
                  create a new page to be used as the blog page. Add a title to
                  this page - in the live preview I have simply called this page
                  Blog.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you have created the page and given it the name you can
                  then publish it.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                  Please note, you do not need to add anything in the post
                  editor as this page will only be created to let WordPress know
                  what page to assign the blog posts to.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can now go into
                  <strong>Settings &rarr; Reading</strong> and assign the Posts
                  page to the Blog page you created. Make sure you Save Changes
                  once you are happy with your settings.
